# **Loan Approval Prediction** 🚀

## **Overview** 📋
The **Loan Approval Prediction** system automates and optimizes the loan approval process by leveraging machine learning techniques. It predicts whether an applicant is eligible for a loan based on key features like income, credit history, and loan amount, saving time and reducing risks for financial institutions.

This project trains a machine learning model using historical data to deliver accurate predictions, ensuring both efficiency and fairness.

## **Project Workflow** 🛠️

### 1. **Data Collection** 📊
   - The dataset includes features like **Gender**, **Marital Status**, **Education**, **Income**, **Loan Amount**, and **Credit History**.
   - **Input Example**: Applicant details like dependents, credit score, and loan tenure.

   **📌 Have to add an image here:** A sample table showing the dataset structure or schema.

### 2. **Preprocessing** 🧹
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing and irrelevant values.
   - **Normalization**: Transforming numerical data to improve model performance.
   - **Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical variables (e.g., Gender) into numerical format for model compatibility.

   ```python
   # Sample code snippet for data cleaning and preprocessing
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("loan_approval_dataset2.csv")
   df.fillna(df.median(), inplace=True)  # Filling missing values with the median
   df['Credit_History'] = df['Credit_History'].astype(int)  # Ensuring proper data types
   ```

   **📌 Add an image here:** A pipeline diagram illustrating the preprocessing workflow.

### 3. **Feature Engineering** 🧠
   - Selected features with the highest influence on loan approval using statistical measures like **information gain**.
   - Normalized variables to ensure consistency in scale.

   **📌 Add an image here:** A bar chart showing feature importance derived from the decision tree.

### 4. **Model Training** 🤖
   - **Algorithm Used**: Decision Tree Classifier.
   - A hierarchical structure is built to classify applicants based on features.
   - The algorithm generates **IF-THEN rules**, making predictions interpretable for financial analysts.

   ```python
   # Training a Decision Tree Classifier
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   X = df.drop("Loan_Status", axis=1)  # Features
   y = df["Loan_Status"]  # Target
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

   model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=5, random_state=42)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

   **📌 Add an image here:** A visual representation of the decision tree or its structure.

### 5. **Prediction** 🔍
   - New applicant data is evaluated using the trained model, and predictions are generated.
   - Results are visualized to highlight accuracy and decision confidence.

   **📌 Add an image here:** A confusion matrix or accuracy graph showcasing model performance.
